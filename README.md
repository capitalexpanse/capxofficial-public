CapX Official Public Development Repo
==================================

### What is CapX?
[CapX](https://capitalexpanse.net) is a hybrid PoW/PoS decentralized [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) with a focus on privacy and security. It will also serve as the conduit for cashflow within the Capital Expanse Platform. CapX  will  be  one  of  the  few  coins  to  offer  a  mobile  miner.  Our  mobile  mining  and  lending  program  will  work  in  conjunction  with  each other and will offer a robust set of rewards and incentives, including a fully Gamified Mining and Lending Program. 
Lend, Mine, Stake, Trade. #Earn.

CapX utilizes POW and POS for a fair and evenly distributed crypto governance for the people. Depending on demand we will cap buy orders in the ICO to limit whales on the platform, and ensure everyone the chance to buy some CapX coin.
